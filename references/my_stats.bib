  Abstract                 = {Multi-parameter evidence synthesis is a generalization of meta-analysis in which several parameters are estimated jointly. Here this approach is applied to a common form of data structure in which mixed pairwise comparisons are made between treatments in a 'chain of evidence' structure. The data set investigated here, which first appeared in the confidence profile method literature, features three types of data relating to thrombolytic treatment following acute myocardial infarction. There is information on reperfusion (coronary patency) following treatment, information on survival in reperfused and non-reperfused patients (conditional survival), and independent information on the effect of treatment on survival without specifying reperfusion state (overall survival). The objective of this study is to explore models for combining these three types of evidence within a single model, and some of the evidence consistency issues that arise. Bayesian Markov chain Monte Carlo methods are used to fit two models. The first, proposed in the confidence profile literature, assumes there are no differences between studies in baseline effects (equal study effects). The second model assumes fixed treatment effects but allows for study differences in baseline reperfusion and conditional survival rates by assuming random study effects. The equal study effects model fits the data poorly, and cross-validation shows that the overall survival evidence is not consistent with the reperfusion and conditional survival evidence under this model. The evidence appears to be consistent within the more loosely structured random study effects model, but results are sensitive to prior assumptions about the between-study variance. The inconsistency between the three evidence types relates to overall survival, rather than to the effect of treatment on survival. Multi-parameter evidence synthesis, with suitable checks for evidence consistency, can be used to help determine whether chains of evidence 'add up' epidemiologically within an overall model, and to construct parameter distributions for an entire model simultaneously, consistent with all the available data.},

  Abstract                 = {Diabetes mellitus (DM) is a major health problem for the aging population. Glycemic control is fundamental to the management of diabetes, as glycemic levels are closely linked to development of diabetes-related complications. Measurement of the hemoglobin A1c (A1c) to assess chronic glycemic control is an integral component of diabetes care. Currently, there is no clear evidence that age alters the relationship between A1c and average blood glucose. The Diabetes Control and Complications trial and the United Kingdom Prospective Diabetes Study are the 2 main studies that have provided evidence leading to the widespread recommendation of A1c monitoring. The American Diabetes Association recommends achieving an A1c level of 7% or lower. However, older diabetics represent a heterogeneous population ranging from frail nursing home residents to active community-dwelling elderly with variable life expectancies. One needs to look at the individual in order to best balance risk versus benefit associated with tight glycemic control. Benefits of intensive therapy in an effort to lower A1c must always be weighed against the greater risk of disabling and unpredictable hypoglycemia, as the geriatric population is less likely to benefit from reducing the risk of microvascular complications and more likely to suffer serious adverse effects from hypoglycemia.}

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Insulin pen devices offer patients a more convenient, accurate, and discreet mode of insulin delivery than traditional syringes and vials. This open-label, randomized, comparative crossover study assessed patient preference for two reusable pens: NovoPen 4 (Novo Nordisk A/S, Copenhagen, Denmark) and OptiClik (Sanofi-Aventis, Bridgewater NJ). METHODS: Thirty-five diabetes patients with no previous experience of pen devices (mean age 56.7 years; range 17-80 years; 57% male) used both pens to deliver a 10 unit saline dose into an injection cushion. Half received guidance according to official instruction manuals, and half were given no instructions. Learning times were also measured. Participants completed a detailed questionnaire to determine their preferences. RESULTS: Overall, 32 of 35 participants preferred NovoPen 4 compared with two of 35 for OptiClik (91.4% vs. 5.7% respectively, P<0.001), and one had no preference. NovoPen 4 was significantly favored over OptiClik in almost all questionnaire criteria, including safety (P<0.001), size of pen (P<0.001), appearance (P<0.001), and ease of use (P<0.001). The majority of patients were able to use NovoPen 4 without guidance (94.4%) compared with just over half for for OptiClik (55.6%, P<0.01). Learning time was also significantly faster for NovoPen 4 (62.6 s) than for OptiClik (95.8 s) (P<0.05). CONCLUSIONS: Patients learned how to use both pens quickly (under 2 min), but NovoPen 4 was preferred by participants over OptiClik. Patient acceptance of a pen device may support insulin initiation, particularly in type 2 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper considers the estimation of Kendall's tau for bivariate data (X, Y) when only Y is subject to right-censoring. Although tau is estimable under weak regularity conditions, the estimators proposed by Brown et a]. [1974. Nonparametric tests of independence for censored data, with applications to heart transplant studies. Reliability and Biometry, 327-354], Weier and Basu [1980. An investigation of Kendall's tau modified for censored data with applications. J. Statist. Plann. Inference 4, 381-390] and Oakes [ 1982. A concordance test for independence in the presence of censoring. Biometrics 38, 451-455], which are standard in this context, fail to be consistent when tau not equal 0 because they only use information from the marginal distributions. An exception is the renormalized estimator of Oakes [2006. On consistency of Kendall's tau under censoring. Technical Report, Department of Biostatistics and Computational Biology, University of Rochester, Rochester, NY], whose consistency has been established for all possible values of tau, but only in the context of the gamma frailty model. Wang and Wells [2000. Estimation of Kendall's tau under censoring. Statist. Sinica 10, 1199-1215] were the first to propose an estimator which accounts for joint information. Four more are developed here: the first three extend the methods of Brown et al. [1974. Nonparametric tests of independence for censored data, with applications to heart transplant studies. Reliability and Biometry, 327-354], Weier and Basu [1980, An investigation of Kendall's tau modified for censored data with applications. J. Statist. Plann.

Biometrics 38, 451-455] to account for information provided by X, while the fourth estimator inverts an estimation of Pr(Y-i <= y vertical bar X-i = x(i), Y-i > c(i)) to get an imputation of the value of Yi censored at C-i = c(i). Following Lim [2006. Permutation procedures with censored data. Comput. Statist. Data Anal. 50, 332-345], a nonparametric estimator is also considered which averages the (tau) over cap (i) obtained from a large number of possible configurations of the observed data (X-1, Z(1)),..., (X-n, Z(n)), where Z(i) = min (Y-i, C-i). Simulations are presented which compare these various estimators of Kendall's tau. An illustration involving the well-known Stanford heart transplant data is also presented. (C) 2006 Elsevier B.V.

A different approach to problems of multiple significance testing is presented. It calls for controlling the expected proportion of falsely rejected hypotheses - the false discovery rate. This error rate is equivalent to the FWER when all hypotheses are true but is smaller otherwise. Therefore, in problems where the control of the false discovery rate rather than that of the FWER is desired, there is potential for a gain in power. A simple sequential Bonferroni-type procedure is proved to control the false discovery rate for independent test statistics, and a simulation study shows that the gain in power is substantial. The use of the new procedure and the appropriateness of the criterion are illustrated with examples.},

The criterion can be used for nested or nonnested models and for multiple model comparison and prediction. From another perspective, the development suggests a general definition of a ''reference prior'' for model comparison.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian statistical methods are being used increasingly in clinical research because the Bayesian approach is ideally suited to adapting to information that accrues during a trial, potentially allowing for smaller more informative trials and for patients to receive better treatment. Accumulating results can be assessed at any time, including continually, with the possibility of modifying the design of the trial, for example, by slowing (or stopping) or expanding accrual, imbalancing randomization to favour better-performing therapies, dropping or adding treatment arms, and changing the trial population to focus on patient subsets that are responding better to the experimental therapies. Bayesian analyses use available patient-outcome information, including biomarkers that accumulating data indicate might be related to clinical outcome. They also allow for the use of historical information and for synthesizing results of relevant trials. Here, I explain the rationale underlying Bayesian clinical trials, and discuss the potential of such trials to improve the effectiveness of drug development.},

  Abstract                 = {"As has been well-discussed, the explosion of interest in Bayesian methods over the last 10 to 20 years has been the result of the convergence of modern computing power and e*cient Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algo- rithms for sampling from and summarizing posterior distributions. Prac- titioners trained in traditional, frequentist statistical methods appear to have been drawn to Bayesian approaches for three reasons. One is that Bayesian approaches implemented with the majority of their informative content coming from the current data, and not any external prior informa- tion, typically have good frequentist properties (e.g., low mean squared er- ror in repeated use). Second, these methods as now readily implemented in WinBUGS and other MCMC-driven software packages now o*er the simplest approach to hierarchical (random e*ects) modeling, as routinely needed in longitudinal, frailty, spatial, time series, and a wide variety of other settings featuring interdependent data. Third, practitioners are attracted by the greater *exibility and adaptivity of the Bayesian approach, which permits stopping for e*cacy, toxicity, and futility, as well as facilitates a straightforward solution to a great many other specialized problems such as dose-nding, adaptive randomization, equivalence testing, and others we shall describe. This book presents the Bayesian adaptive approach to the design and analysis of clinical trials"--Provided by publisher.},

The monotone function is modeled as a mixture of shifted and scaled parametric probability distribution functions, and a general random probability measure is assumed as the prior for the mixing distribution. We investigate the choice of the underlying parametric distribution function and find that the two-sided power distribution function is well suited both from a computational and mathematical point of view. The model is motivated by traditional nonlinear models for dose-response analysis, and provides possibilities to elicitate informative prior distributions on different aspects of the curve. The method is compared with other recent approaches to monotone nonparametric regression in a simulation study and is illustrated on a data set from dose-response analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {When little or no data directly comparing two treatments are available, investigators often rely on indirect comparisons from studies testing the treatments against a control or placebo. One approach to indirect comparison is to pool findings from the active treatment arms of the original controlled trials. This approach offers no advantage over a comparison of observational study data and is prone to bias. We present an alternative model that evaluates the differences between treatment and placebo in two sets of clinical trials, and preserves the randomization of the originally assigned patient groups. We apply the method to data on sulphamethoxazole-trimethoprim or dapsone/pyrimethamine as prophylaxis against Pneumocystis carinii in HIV infected patients. The indirect comparison showed substantial increased benefit from the former (odds ratio 0.37, 95% CI 0.21 to 0.65), while direct comparisons from randomized trials suggests a much smaller difference (risk ratio 0.64, 95% CI 0.45 to 0.90; p-value for difference of effect = 0.11). Direct comparisons of treatments should be sought. When direct comparisons are unavailable, indirect comparison meta-analysis should evaluate the magnitude of treatment effects across studies, recognizing the limited strength of inference.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a triple-blind, placebo-controlled, 30-week study conducted at 101 sites in the U.S. After a 4-week, single-blind, placebo lead-in period, 377 subjects were randomized (60% men, age 55 +/- 11 years, BMI 33 +/- 6 kg/m(2), HbA(1c) 8.6 +/- 1.2% [+/-SD]) and began 4 weeks at 5 microg subcutaneous exenatide twice daily (before breakfast and dinner; arms A and B) or placebo. Subsequently, subjects in arm B were escalated to 10 microg b.i.d. exenatide. All subjects continued sulfonylurea therapy. RESULTS: At week 30, HbA(1c) changes from baseline were -0.86 +/- 0.11, -0.46 +/- 0.12, and 0.12 +/- 0.09% (+/-SE) in the 10-microg, 5-microg, and placebo arms, respectively (adjusted P < 0.001). Of evaluable subjects with baseline HbA(1c) > 7% (n = 237), 41% (10 microg), 33% (5 microg), and 9% (placebo) achieved HbA(1c) <or= 7% (P < 0.001). Fasting plasma glucose concentrations decreased in the 10-microg arm compared with placebo (P < 0.05). Subjects in the exenatide arms had dose-dependent progressive weight loss, with an end-of-study loss in the 10-microg exenatide arm of -1.6 +/- 0.3 kg from baseline (P < 0.05 vs. placebo). The most frequent adverse events were generally mild or moderate and gastrointestinal in nature. No severe hypoglycemia was observed. CONCLUSIONS: Exenatide significantly reduced HbA(1c) in patients with type 2 diabetes failing maximally effective doses of a sulfonylurea. Exenatide was generally well tolerated and was associated with weight loss.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the initiation phase, patients were randomized to LM75/25 or glargine. After 6 months, patients with A1C </= 7.0% advanced to the maintenance phase for </= 24 months. The primary objective was the between-group comparison of duration of maintaining the A1C goal. RESULTS: Of 900 patients receiving LM75/25 and 918 patients receiving glargine who completed initiation, 473 and 419, respectively, had A1C </= 7.0% and continued into maintenance. Baseline characteristics except age were similar in this group. Median time of maintaining the A1C goal was 16.8 months for LM75/25 (95% CI 14.0-19.7) and 14.4 months for glargine (95% CI 13.4-16.8; P = 0.040). A1C goal was maintained in 202 LM75/25-treated patients (43%) and in 147 glargine-treated patients (35%; P = 0.006). No differences were observed in overall, nocturnal, or severe hypoglycemia. LM75/25 patients had higher total daily insulin dose (0.45 +/- 0.21 vs. 0.37 +/- 0.21 units/kg/day) and more weight gain (5.4 +/- 5.8 vs. 3.7 +/- 5.6 kg) from baseline. Patients taking LM75/25 and glargine with lower baseline A1C levels were more likely to maintain the A1C goal (P = 0.043 and P < 0.001, respectively). CONCLUSIONS: A modestly longer durability of glycemic control was achieved with LM75/25 compared with glargine. Patients with lower baseline A1C levels were more likely to maintain the goal, supporting the concept of earlier insulin initiation.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: To compare the ability of two starter insulin regimens to achieve glycemic control in a large, ethnically diverse population with type 2 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: During the initiation phase of the DURABLE trial, patients were randomized to a twice-daily lispro mix 75/25 (LM75/25; 75% lispro protamine suspension, 25% lispro) (n = 1,045) or daily glargine (GL) (n = 1,046) with continuation of prestudy oral antihyperglycemic drugs. RESULTS: Baseline A1C was similar (LM75/25: 9.1 +/- 1.3%; GL: 9.0 +/- 1.2%; P = 0.414). At 24 weeks, LM75/25 patients had lower A1C than GL patients (7.2 +/- 1.1 vs. 7.3 +/- 1.1%, P = 0.005), greater A1C reduction (-1.8 +/- 1.3 vs. -1.7 +/- 1.3%, P = 0.005), and higher percentage reaching A1C target <7.0% (47.5 vs. 40.3%, P < 0.001). LM75/25 was associated with higher insulin dose (0.47 +/- 0.23 vs. 0.40 +/- 0.23 units x kg(-1) x day(-1), P < 0.001) and more weight gain (3.6 +/- 4.0 vs. 2.5 +/- 4.0 kg, P < 0.0001). LM75/25 patients had a higher overall hypoglycemia rate than GL patients (28.0 +/- 41.6 vs. 23.1 +/- 40.7 episodes x pt(-1) x year(-1), P = 0.007) but lower nocturnal hypoglycemia rate (8.9 +/- 19.3 vs. 11.4 +/- 25.3 episodes x pt(-1) x year(-1), P = 0.009). Severe hypoglycemia rates were low in both groups (LM75/25: 0.10 +/- 1.6 vs. GL: 0.03 +/- 0.3 episodes x pt(-1) x year(-1), P = 0.167). CONCLUSIONS: Compared with GL, LM75/25 resulted in slightly lower A1C at 24 weeks and a moderately higher percentage reaching A1C target <7.0%. Patients receiving LM75/25 experienced more weight gain and higher rates of overall hypoglycemia but lower rates of nocturnal hypoglycemia. Durability of regimens will be evaluated in the following 2-year maintenance phase.},

  Abstract                 = {Purpose The traditional end point for assessing efficacy of first-line chemotherapies for advanced cancer is overall survival (OS), but this end point requires prolonged follow-up and is potentially confounded by the effects of second-line therapies. We investigated whether progression-free survival (PFS) could be considered a valid surrogate for OS in advanced colorectal cancer. Patients and Methods Individual patient data were available from 10 historical trials comparing fluouracil (FU) + leucovorin with either FU alone (1,744 patients) or with raltitrexed (1,345 patients) and from three validation trials comparing FU + leucovorin with or without irinotecan or oxaliplatin (1,263 patients). Correlation coefficients were estimated in historical trials between the end points of PFS and OS, and between the treatment effects on these end points. Treatment effects on OS were predicted in validation trials, and compared with the observed effects. Results In historical trials, 1,760 patients (57%) had progressed or died at 6 months, and 1,622 (52%) had died at 12 months. The rank correlation coefficient between PFS and OS was equal to 0.82 (95% Cl, 0.82 to 0.83). The correlation coefficient between treatment effects on PFS and on OS ranged from 0.99 (95% Cl, 0.94 to 1.04) when all trials were considered to 0.74 (95% Cl, 0.44 to 1.04) after exclusion of one highly influential trial. In the validation trials, the observed OS hazard ratios were within the 95% prediction intervals. A hazard ratio of 0.77 or lower in terms of PFS would predict a benefit in terms of OS. Conclusion PFS is an acceptable surrogate for OS in advanced colorectal cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {This paper describes the distinction between the concept of statistical power and the probability of getting a successful trial. While one can choose a very high statistical power to detect a certain treatment effect, the high statistical power does not necessarily translate to a high success probability if the treatment effect to detect is based on the perceived ability of the drug candidate. The crucial factor hinges on our knowledge of the drug's ability to deliver the effect used to power the study. The paper discusses a framework to calculate the 'average success probability' and demonstrates how uncertainty about the treatment effect could affect the average success probability for a confirmatory trial. It complements an earlier work by O'Hagan et al. (Pharmaceutical Statistics 2005; 4:187-201) published in this journal. Computer codes to calculate the average success probability are included.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: This was a randomized, open-label, 2-period, 8-sequence crossover study in insulin pen-naive patients with diabetes. Randomized patients (N = 367) received device training, then simulated low- (15 U) and high- (60 U) dose insulin injections with an appliance. Patients rated pens using an ease of use questionnaire and were asked separately for final pen preferences. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURES: The Insulin Device 'Ease of Use' Battery is a 10-item questionnaire with a 7-point scale (higher scores reflect greater ease of use). The primary objective was to determine pen preference for 'easy to press to inject my dose' (by comparing composite scores [low- plus high-dose]). Secondary objectives were to determine pen preference on select questionnaire items (from composite scores), final pen preference, and summary responses for all questionnaire items. RESULTS: On the primary endpoint, 'easy to press to inject my dose,' a statistically significant majority of patients with a preference chose the insulin lispro pen over the insulin aspart pen (68.4%, 95% CI = 62.7-73.6%). Statistically significant majorities of patients with a preference also favored the insulin lispro pen on secondary items: 'easy to hold in my hand when I inject' (64.9%, 95% CI = 58.8-70.7%), 'easy to use when I am in a public place' (67.5%, 95% CI = 61.0-73.6%), and 'overall easy to use' (69.9%, 95% CI = 63.9-75.4%). A statistically significant majority of patients had a final preference for the insulin lispro pen (67.3%, 95% CI = 62.2-72.1%). CONCLUSIONS: Among pen-naive patients with diabetes who had a preference, the majority preferred the insulin lispro pen over the insulin aspart pen with regard to ease of use. Study limitations included open-label design and injection simulation, use of an unvalidated questionnaire, and enrollment of mostly insulin-naive patients.},

  Abstract                 = {A clinical-psychological study was carried out in 224 insulin-dependent diabetic patients, distributed into two groups according to the frequency of hypoglycemic episodes. Group. A included 124 patients, 65 men and 59 women (mean age 35 +/- 18 years), who reported frequent episodes of hypoglycemia (HG). In the 100 patients of group B (46 men and 54 women with a mean age of 37 +/- 10 years), the HG episodes were only occasional. The degree and type of anxiety were evaluated using: (1) a semistructured interview to determine the HG frequency and intensity; (2) the anxiety scale for HG, with two sections: a) 15 items about the behaviour to prevent HG occurrence and b) 10 items for the anxiety level; (3) the questionnaire of anxiety with 40 items. Highly significant differences between groups were found for the degree of anxiety about HG, particularly for the frequency of high anxiety scores (with ideative ruminations or generalized anxiety, accompanied or not by agoraphobia) (73.86% in group A versus 34.09% in group B; p < 0.001). Relatively significant differences were recorded with respect to the compliance to treatment (preventive behaviour for HG) as well as for the anxiety index (47.95% in group A versus 33.45% in group B), with a prevalence of the covered anxiety in group A and of the overt anxiety scores, indicating a dissimilation tendency of the adaptative role of anxiety as a signal of communication.},

  Abstract                 = {Hypoglycaemia is the limiting factor in the glycaemic management of diabetes. Iatrogenic hypoglycaemia is typically the result of the interplay of insulin excess and compromised glucose counterregulation in Type I (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus. Insulin concentrations do not decrease and glucagon and epinephrine concentrations do not increase normally as glucose concentrations decrease. The concept of hypoglycaemia-associated autonomic failure (HAAF) in Type I diabetes posits that recent antecedent iatrogenic hypoglycaemia causes both defective glucose counterregulation (by reducing the epinephrine response in the setting of an absent glucagon response) and hypoglycaemia unawareness (by reducing the autonomic and the resulting neurogenic symptom responses). Perhaps the most compelling support for HAAF is the finding that as little as 2 to 3 weeks of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia reverses hypoglycaemia unawareness and improves the reduced epinephrine component of defective glucose counterregulation in most affected patients. The mediator and mechanism of HAAF are not known but are under active investigation. The glucagon response to hypoglycaemia is also reduced in patients approaching the insulin deficient end of the spectrum of Type II (non-insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, and glycaemic thresholds for autonomic (including epinephrine) and symptomatic responses to hypoglycaemia are shifted to lower plasma glucose concentrations after hypoglycaemia in Type II diabetes. Thus, patients with advanced Type II diabetes are also at risk for HAAF. While it is possible to minimise the risk of hypoglycaemia by reducing risks -- including a 2 to 3 week period of scrupulous avoidance of hypoglycaemia in patients with hypoglycaemia unawareness -- methods that provide glucose-regulated insulin replacement or secretion are needed to eliminate hypoglycaemia and maintain euglycaemia over a lifetime of diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {The objective of these two studies was to assess patient acceptance and feature preferences of the new Lilly 3.0 ml pre-filled pen. A total of 701 patients with diabetes mellitus, who required insulin, were treated for 4-6 weeks with the pre-filled pen. Patient acceptance and treatment preferences were assessed by a questionnaire completed at the end of the study period. Patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus from South Africa (n = 371) and Croatia (n = 330) were enrolled in the study. The mean age was 51.6 years (range: 18-81), and gender was 359 males and 342 females. Prior to the study, patients in South Africa (SA) had used the Novo Actraphane (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) pen set, and patients in Croatia (C) had used NovoPen 1 or 2 (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) (38.8%), NovoPen 3 (Novo Nordisk, Bagsvaerd, Denmark) (28.8%), B-D Pen (Becton-Dickinson, Franklin Lakes, New Jersey, USA) (18.8%), needle/syringe (10.0%), oral hypoglycaemic agents (2.1%), or unknown (1.5%). The new Lilly 3.0 ml pre-filled pen features that were rated by respondents as good to excellent on a five-point rating scale included: cartridge visibility (C = 94%, SA = 83%), ease of dose correction (C = 92%, SA = 85%), dialling of the dose (C = 89%, SA = 81%), turning of the dose knob (C = 84%, SA = 82%) and attaching needles (C = 92%, SA = 78%). Most respondents (C = 78%, SA = 75%) preferred single-unit versus two-unit dosage increments. Overall, 76% of patients in Croatia and 80% in South Africa preferred the Lilly 3.0 ml pre-filled pen to their previous delivery device; 84% and 87% of patients, respectively, would recommend the pen to another patient. Also, the majority of patients in both trials rated the new Lilly 3.0 ml pre-filled pen as being more convenient and easier to use, and indicated that it represented a significant or modest improvement over their previous insulin injection method. The results of this study confirm that the new Lilly 3.0 ml pre-filled pen is widely accepted and preferred by patients using both reusable and pre-filled devices.},

We confirmed the majority of published data on incidence and causes of hypoglycemia and added some new information on the complex symptomatology and fear of hypoglycemia. Longer duration of IDDM induced a change in the symptomatology of hypoglycemia, consisting of a reduced occurrence of autonomic symptoms, namely tremor, and a parallel increased experience of neuroglycopenic symptoms, particularly drowsiness, difficulty in concentrating, and lack of coordination. The latter symptoms were found more frequently in patients with partial unawareness, more severe episodes and higher fear of hypoglycemia. These observations draw attention to the neuroglycopenic symptoms as important warning cues of hypoglycemia. We emphasized the necessity of observing the change in the frequency of symptoms experienced by patients, in particular autonomic and neuroglycopenic symptoms, in order to educate patients to preserve a normal awareness of hypoglycemia and prevent severe episodes.},

However, current methods ignore some aspects of the definitions of progression-related endpoints. We review those definitions and investigate their impact on modeling the joint distribution. Further, we propose a multi-state model in which the association between the endpoints is modeled through a frailty term. We also argue that interval-censoring needs to be taken into account to more closely match the latent disease evolution. The joint distribution and an expression for Kendall's tau are derived. The model is applied to data from a clinical trial in advanced metastatic ovarian cancer.},

A Dirichlet process mixture of Poisson distributions is used to avoid parametric assumptions on the conditional distribution of Y given X and Z. Then, to also avoid parametric assumptions on f(x), a novel prior formulation is proposed that enforces the nondecreasing constraint and assigns positive prior probability to the null hypothesis of no association. Through the use of carefully tailored hyperprior distributions, we allow for borrowing of information across different regions of X in estimating f(x) and in assessing hypotheses about local increases in the function. Due to conjugacy properties, posterior computation is straightforward using a Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithm. The methods are illustrated using data from an epidemiologic study of sleep problems and obesity.},

  Abstract                 = {The Confidence Profile Method is a new Bayesian method that can be used to assess technologies where the available evidence involves a variety of experimental designs, types of outcomes, and effect measures; a variety of biases; combinations of biases and nested bases; uncertainty about biases; an underlying variability in the parameter of interest; indirect evidence; and technology families. The result of an analysis with the Confidence Profile Method is a posterior distribution for the parameter of interest, posterior distributions for other parameters, and a covariance matrix for all the parameters in the model. The posterior distributions incorporate all the uncertainty the assessor chooses to describe about any of the parameters used in the analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To investigate the frequency of severe hypoglycemia (SH) and hypoglycemic coma during the first trimester of type 1 diabetic pregnancy and in the 4 months before gestation and to identify risk indicators predicting first trimester SH in a nonselected nationwide cohort of pregnant women with type 1 diabetes. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: We conducted a longitudinal cohort survey in 278 pregnant type 1 diabetic women using questionnaires at inclusion and at 17 weeks of gestation, addressing the frequencies of SH (i.e., external help required) and hypoglycemic coma, general characteristics, hypoglycemia awareness, blood glucose symptom threshold, and the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey. RESULTS: The occurrence of SH (including hypoglycemic coma) rose from 0.9 +/- 2.4 episodes per 4 months before gestation to 2.6 +/- 6.3 episodes during the first trimester (P < 0.001), including an increase in episodes of coma from 0.3 +/- 1.3 to 0.7 +/- 3.7 (P=0.03). The proportion of women affected by SH rose from 25 to 41% (P < 0.001). First-trimester SH was independently related to a history of SH before gestation (odds ratio [95%CI]: 9.2 [3.9-21.7]), a 10 years' longer diabetes duration (1.6 [1.0-2.4]), an HbA1c level < or = 6.5% (2.5 [1.3-5.0]), and a 0.1 unit/kg higher daily insulin dose (5.4 [1.5-18.9]), adjusted for a decreased symptom threshold. CONCLUSIONS: In type 1 diabetic pregnancy, the risk of SH is increased already before pregnancy and rises further during the first trimester. A history of SH before gestation, longer duration of diabetes, an HbA1c level < or = 6.5%, and a higher total daily insulin dose were risk indicators predictive for SH during the first trimester. Further research should aim to elucidate how the benefits of strict glycemic control balance with the markedly increased risk of SH early in pregnancy.},

The joint distribution of the events is formulated via a gamma frailty model in the upper wedge where data are observable (Day et al., 1997), with the marginal distributions unspecified. An estimator for the association parameter is obtained from a concordance estimating function. A novel plug-in estimator for the marginal distribution of the non-terminal event is shown to be uniformly consistent and to converge weakly to a Gaussian process. The assumptions on the joint distribution outside the upper wedge are weaker than those usually made in competing risks analyses. Simulations demonstrate that the methods work well with practical sample sizes. The proposals are illustrated with data on morbidity and mortality in leukaemia patients.},

The objective of the procedure is to reduce the duration of a survival study relative to classical procedure. A surrogate endpoint is an event which is related to survival time and may occur earlier during follow up. In the first stage, all patients are followed to the primary endpoint in order to evaluate the strength of the relationship between the surrogate endpoint and survival. In the second stage, follow up is terminated on patients who reach the surrogate endpoint. Indirect inferences on the survival endpoint is now possible by virtue of the first stage analysis. We present methods for data collected in the two-stage procedure, for estimating the survivorship function, S(t), and for comparing two treatment groups using a non-parametric permutation test. The methods are applied to the results of a study of resected lung cancer.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Despite the popularity of the low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat (Atkins) diet, no randomized, controlled trials have evaluated its efficacy. METHODS: We conducted a one-year, multicenter, controlled trial involving 63 obese men and women who were randomly assigned to either a low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diet or a low-calorie, high-carbohydrate, low-fat (conventional) diet. Professional contact was minimal to replicate the approach used by most dieters. RESULTS: Subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet had lost more weight than subjects on the conventional diet at 3 months (mean [+/-SD], -6.8+/-5.0 vs. -2.7+/-3.7 percent of body weight; P=0.001) and 6 months (-7.0+/-6.5 vs. -3.2+/-5.6 percent of body weight, P=0.02), but the difference at 12 months was not significant (-4.4+/-6.7 vs. -2.5+/-6.3 percent of body weight, P=0.26). After three months, no significant differences were found between the groups in total or low-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations. The increase in high-density lipoprotein cholesterol concentrations and the decrease in triglyceride concentrations were greater among subjects on the low-carbohydrate diet than among those on the conventional diet throughout most of the study. Both diets significantly decreased diastolic blood pressure and the insulin response to an oral glucose load. CONCLUSIONS: The low-carbohydrate diet produced a greater weight loss (absolute difference, approximately 4 percent) than did the conventional diet for the first six months, but the differences were not significant at one year. The low-carbohydrate diet was associated with a greater improvement in some risk factors for coronary heart disease. Adherence was poor and attrition was high in both groups. Longer and larger studies are required to determine the long-term safety and efficacy of low-carbohydrate, high-protein, high-fat diets.},

  Abstract                 = {In recent years, Bayesian response-adaptive designs have been used to improve the efficiency of learning in dose-finding studies. Many current methods for analyzing the data at the time of the interim analysis only use the data from patients who have completed the study. Therefore, data collected at intermediate time points are not used for decision making in these studies. However, in some disease areas such as diabetes and obesity, patients may need to be studied for several weeks or months for a drug effect to emerge. Additionally, slow enrollment rates can limit the number of patients who complete the study in a given period of time. Consequently, at the time of an interim analysis, there may be only a small proportion (e.g., 20%) of patients who have completed the study. In this paper, we propose a new Bayesian prediction model to incorporate all the data (from patients who have completed the study and those who have not completed) to make decisions about the study at the interim analysis. Examples of decisions made at the interim analysis include adaptive treatment allocation, dropping nonefficacious dose arms, stopping the study for positive efficacy, and stopping the study for futility. The model is able to handle incomplete longitudinal data including missing data considered missing at random (MAR). A utility-function-based decision rule is also discussed. The benefit of our new method is demonstrated through trial simulations. Three scenarios are examined, and the simulation results demonstrate that this new method outperforms traditional design with the same sample size in each of these scenarios.}

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: To survey the frequency of use of indirect comparisons in systematic reviews and evaluate the methods used in their analysis and interpretation. Also to identify alternative statistical approaches for the analysis of indirect comparisons, to assess the properties of different statistical methods used for performing indirect comparisons and to compare direct and indirect estimates of the same effects within reviews. DATA SOURCES: Electronic databases. REVIEW METHODS: The Database of Abstracts of Reviews of Effects (DARE) was searched for systematic reviews involving meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials (RCTs) that reported both direct and indirect comparisons, or indirect comparisons alone. A systematic review of MEDLINE and other databases was carried out to identify published methods for analysing indirect comparisons. Study designs were created using data from the International Stroke Trial. Random samples of patients receiving aspirin, heparin or placebo in 16 centres were used to create meta-analyses, with half of the trials comparing aspirin and placebo and half heparin and placebo. Methods for indirect comparisons were used to estimate the contrast between aspirin and heparin. The whole process was repeated 1000 times and the results were compared with direct comparisons and also theoretical results. Further detailed case studies comparing the results from both direct and indirect comparisons of the same effects were undertaken. RESULTS: Of the reviews identified through DARE, 31/327 (9.5%) included indirect comparisons. A further five reviews including indirect comparisons were identified through electronic searching. Few reviews carried out a formal analysis and some based analysis on the naive addition of data from the treatment arms of interest. Few methodological papers were identified. Some valid approaches for aggregate data that could be applied using standard software were found: the adjusted indirect comparison, meta-regression and, for binary data only, multiple logistic regression (fixed effect models only). Simulation studies showed that the naive method is liable to bias and also produces over-precise answers. Several methods provide correct answers if strong but unverifiable assumptions are fulfilled. Four times as many similarly sized trials are needed for the indirect approach to have the same power as directly randomised comparisons. Detailed case studies comparing direct and indirect comparisons of the same effect show considerable statistical discrepancies, but the direction of such discrepancy is unpredictable. CONCLUSIONS: Direct evidence from good-quality RCTs should be used wherever possible. Without this evidence, it may be necessary to look for indirect comparisons from RCTs. However, the results may be susceptible to bias. When making indirect comparisons within a systematic review, an adjusted indirect comparison method should ideally be used employing the random effects model. If both direct and indirect comparisons are possible within a review, it is recommended that these be done separately before considering whether to pool data. There is a need to evaluate methods for the analysis of indirect comparisons for continuous data and for empirical research into how different methods of indirect comparison perform in cases where there is a large treatment effect. Further study is needed into when it is appropriate to look at indirect comparisons and when to combine both direct and indirect comparisons. Research into how evidence from indirect comparisons compares to that from non-randomised studies may also be warranted. Investigations using individual patient data from a meta-analysis of several RCTs using different protocols and an evaluation of the impact of choosing different binary effect measures for the inverse variance method would also be useful.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Interim analysis of Phase III trials typically includes testing for both efficacy and futility. Futility testing is commonly performed on the primary outcome at very low levels (e.g., one-sided alpha=0.0025) at one or two times before final analysis. When overall survival is the primary outcome and events accrue slowly, and if a suitable intermediate endpoint is available, then using this endpoint for interim futility testing may yield a higher probability of stopping early for futility in the absence of any treatment effect. PURPOSE: The purpose of this study is to explore the possibility of incorporating an intermediate endpoint into interim futility testing of Phase III trials. METHODS: Using a simple two-stage exponential survival model based on recent Southwest Oncology Group Phase III studies in several disease settings, we perform a series of simulation studies. Survival data are simulated under both the null and alternative hypotheses, and analyzed using overall survival, progression-free survival, and a composite endpoint for futility testing. RESULTS: In all disease settings examined here, when survival data were simulated under the null hypothesis, the probability of stopping a trial early for futility was substantially increased by incorporating PFS into interim futility analyses. When testing for futility with the composite endpoint, average patient accrual was reduced by 6-11% in a wide variety of disease settings. In the study scenario with the longest survival, the savings in study duration was more dramatic than in patient resources. When data were simulated under the alternative hypothesis, this procedure resulted in a negligible loss of power. LIMITATIONS: The properties of this procedure outside of the context of cancer clinical trials and/or using a different intermediate endpoint are not examined. These results also do not address its performance in the context of less conservative stopping rules. CONCLUSIONS: Interim futility monitoring of Phase III trials using a suitable intermediate endpoint may substantially increase the probability of stopping early for futility when there is no treatment effect. These simulation studies suggest that this would lead to meaningful reductions in study duration and patient resources in many disease settings, with no substantial loss of power for the primary test of efficacy. Future work is needed to explore in detail whether modifications to the stopping rules used in this procedure may yield greater savings without compromising power.},

It is shown that if the observed difference is the true one, the probability of repeating a statistically significant result, the 'replication probability', is substantially lower than expected. The reason for this is a mistake that generates other seeming paradoxes: the interpretation of the post-trial p-value in the same way as the pre-trial alpha error. The replication probability can be used as a frequentist counterpart of Bayesian and likelihood methods to show that p-values overstate the evidence against the null hypothesis.},

  Abstract                 = {Many clinical trials and other medical and reliability studies generate both longitudinal (repeated measurement) and survival (time to event) data. Many well-established methods exist for analyzing such data separately, but these may be inappropriate when the longitudinal variable is correlated with patient health status, hence the survival endpoint (as well as the possibility of study dropout). To remedy this, an earlier article proposed a joint model for longitudinal and survival data, obtaining maximum likelihood estimates via the EM algorithm. The longitudinal and survival responses are assumed independent given a linking latent bivariate Gaussian process and available covariates. We develop a fully Bayesian version of this approach, implemented via Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) methods. We use the approach to jointly model the longitudinal and survival data from an AIDS clinical trial comparing two treatments, didanosine (ddI) and zalcitabine (ddC). Despite the complexity of the model, we find it to be relatively straightforward to implement and understand using the WinBUGS software. Wee compare our results to those obtained from readily available alternatives in SAS Procs MIXED, NLMIXED, PHREG, and LIFEREG, as well as Bayesian analogues of these traditional separate likelihood methods. The joint Bayesian approach appears to offer significantly improved and enhanced estimation of median survival times and other parameters of interest, as well as simpler coding and comparable runtimes.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE A recent randomized trial compared prandial insulin aspart (IAsp) with human insulin in type 1 diabetic pregnancy. The aim of this exploratory analysis was to investigate the incidence of severe hypoglycemia during pregnancy and compare women enrolled preconception with women enrolled during early pregnancy. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS IAsp administered immediately before each meal was compared with human insulin administered 30 min before each meal in 99 subjects (44 to IAsp and 55 to human insulin) randomly assigned preconception and in 223 subjects (113 for IAsp and 110 for human insulin) randomly assigned in early pregnancy (<10 weeks). NPH insulin was the basal insulin. Severe hypoglycemia (requiring third-party assistance) was recorded prospectively preconception (where possible), during pregnancy, and postpartum. Relative risk (RR) of severe hypoglycemia was evaluated with a gamma frailty model. RESULTS Of the patients, 23% experienced severe hypoglycemia during pregnancy with the peak incidence in early pregnancy. In the first half of pregnancy, the RR of severe hypoglycemia in women randomly assigned in early pregnancy/preconception was 1.70 (95% CI 0.91-3.18, P = 0.097); the RR in the second half of pregnancy was 1.35 (0.38-4.77, P = 0.640). In women randomly assigned preconception, severe hypoglycemia rates occurring before and during the first and second halves of pregnancy and postpartum for IAsp versus human insulin were 0.9 versus 2.4, 0.9 versus 2.4, 0.3 versus 1.2, and 0.2 versus 2.2 episodes per patient per year, respectively (NS). CONCLUSIONS These data suggest that initiation of insulin analog treatment preconception rather than during early pregnancy may result in a lower risk of severe hypoglycemia in women with type 1 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence-based health care decision making requires comparison of all relevant competing interventions. In the absence of randomized controlled trials involving a direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best treatment(s). Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network meta-analysis, combine direct evidence and indirect evidence for particular pairwise comparisons, thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than traditional meta-analysis. This report from the International Society for Pharmacoeconomics and Outcomes Research Indirect Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on technical aspects of conducting network meta-analyses (our use of this term includes most methods that involve meta-analysis in the context of a network of evidence). We start with a discussion of strategies for developing networks of evidence. Next we briefly review assumptions of network meta-analysis. Then we focus on the statistical analysis of the data: objectives, models (fixed-effects and random-effects), frequentist versus Bayesian approaches, and model validation. A checklist highlights key components of network meta-analysis, and substantial examples illustrate indirect treatment comparisons (both frequentist and Bayesian approaches) and network meta-analysis. A further section discusses eight key areas for future research.}

  Abstract                 = {We introduce a procedure for generalized monotonic curve fitting that is based on a Bayesian analysis of the isotonic regression model. Conventional isotonic regression fits monotonically increasing step functions to data. In our approach we treat the number and location of the steps as random. For each step level we adopt the conjugate prior to the sampling distribution of the data as if the curve was unconstrained. We then propose to use Markov chain Monte Carlo simulation to draw samples from the unconstrained model space and retain only those samples for which the monotonic constraint holds. The proportion of the samples collected for which the constraint holds can be used to provide a value for the weight of evidence in terms of Bayes factors for monotonicity given the data. Using the samples, probability statements can be made about other quantities of interest such as the number of change points in the data and posterior distributions on the location of the change points can be provided. The method is illustrated throughout by a reanalysis of the leukaemia data studied by Schell and Singh. Copyright (C) 2003 John Wiley Sons, Ltd.},

METHODS: This open-label, randomized, crossover 1-day study tested the hypotheses that KwikPen was preferred to vial and syringe, and if this was found to be a significant preference, that KwikPen was preferred to FlexPen. Accuracy of doses prepared, ease of use via insulin device assessment battery, and preference via insulin device preference battery were administered following each pen evaluation, and a final preference question administered following the evaluation of both pens. Clinical measures were not included as subjects injected into an appliance to simulate the injection experience. Primary outcome variables were evaluated by Question 13 of the insulin device preference battery and the final preference question. RESULTS: Among 232 enrolled patients randomized to 1 of 4 sequences (n = 58), Humalog KwikPen was significantly preferred over vial and syringe and over FlexPen. After patients were asked to assess Humalog KwikPen or FlexPen versus V&S by choosing "strongly agreed" or "agreed" to the following attributes: easy to use, easy to hold in their hands when injecting, and easy to press the injection button, the results exhibited significant differences in patient responses. Humalog KwikPen was significantly more accurate and was preferred to vial and syringe in appearance, quality, discretion, convenience, public use, easy to learn, easy to use, reliability, dose confidence, following insulin regimen, overall satisfaction, and recommendation to others. CONCLUSIONS: Humalog KwikPen was significantly preferred over vial and syringe and FlexPen. When compared with vial and syringe, Humalog KwikPen and FlexPen were easier to use and operate, demonstrated superior accuracy of doses prepared, and preferred by pen-naive users.},

  Abstract                 = {Among diabetic patients, experience with hypoglycemia ranges from the unpleasant to the life threatening. The aversiveness of these episodes often results in fear. To examine the impact of hypoglycemia on fear, 69 patients with insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus completed the Behavior and Worry subscales of the Hypoglycemia Fear Survey along with measures of psychological symptoms, perceived stress, risk of future hypoglycemic episodes, and glycosylated hemoglobin. Behavior and Worry scores were positively related to psychological symptoms, perceived stress, and previous experiences with hypoglycemia. Fear was unrelated to glycosylated hemoglobin but was significantly higher for patients who had greater variability and lower mean daily blood glucose.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: Pairwise meta-analysis, indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis for aggregate level survival data are often based on the reported hazard ratio, which relies on the proportional hazards assumption. This assumption is implausible when hazard functions intersect, and can have a huge impact on decisions based on comparisons of expected survival, such as cost-effectiveness analysis. METHODS: As an alternative to network meta-analysis of survival data in which the treatment effect is represented by the constant hazard ratio, a multi-dimensional treatment effect approach is presented. With fractional polynomials the hazard functions of interventions compared in a randomized controlled trial are modeled, and the difference between the parameters of these fractional polynomials within a trial are synthesized (and indirectly compared) across studies. RESULTS: The proposed models are illustrated with an analysis of survival data in non-small-cell lung cancer. Fixed and random effects first and second order fractional polynomials were evaluated. CONCLUSION: (Network) meta-analysis of survival data with models where the treatment effect is represented with several parameters using fractional polynomials can be more closely fitted to the available data than meta-analysis based on the constant hazard ratio.},

MTC allow for indirect comparisons and can therefore provide very useful information for clinical and reimbursement decision-making in the absence of head-to-head data. In this article, we provide an introductory overview of MTC illustrated with example analyses of different drug treatments in rheumatoid arthritis using a continuous patient-reported end point. As a background, we start with an overview of the traditional meta-analyses for pairwise trials, and the difference between a traditional approach and a Bayesian approach. Next, the Bayesian MTC for continuous outcomes are presented. We finish with a discussion of how MTC can best be presented in order to maximize acceptance by target audiences, i.e., clinicians and market access decision-makers.},

  Abstract                 = {Evidence-based health-care decision making requires comparisons of all relevant competing interventions. In the absence of randomized, controlled trials involving a direct comparison of all treatments of interest, indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis provide useful evidence for judiciously selecting the best choice(s) of treatment. Mixed treatment comparisons, a special case of network meta-analysis, combine direct and indirect evidence for particular pairwise comparisons, thereby synthesizing a greater share of the available evidence than a traditional meta-analysis. This report from the ISPOR Indirect Treatment Comparisons Good Research Practices Task Force provides guidance on the interpretation of indirect treatment comparisons and network meta-analysis to assist policymakers and health-care professionals in using its findings for decision making. We start with an overview of how networks of randomized, controlled trials allow multiple treatment comparisons of competing interventions. Next, an introduction to the synthesis of the available evidence with a focus on terminology, assumptions, validity, and statistical methods is provided, followed by advice on critically reviewing and interpreting an indirect treatment comparison or network meta-analysis to inform decision making. We finish with a discussion of what to do if there are no direct or indirect treatment comparisons of randomized, controlled trials possible and a health-care decision still needs to be made.}

  Abstract                 = {Insulin therapy has proven benefits in Type 2 diabetes patients when combination therapy has failed. However, there is some reluctance by both patients and healthcare professionals to initiate insulin therapy. This reluctance has been termed 'psychological insulin resistance'. Barriers to the initiation of insulin therapy include patients' fear of disease progression and needle anxiety; mutual concerns about hypoglycaemia and weight gain; and health professionals' use of insulin as a threat to encourage compliance with earlier therapies. It is essential that these obstacles are identified and investigated as a means of overcoming these impediments to recommended levels of glycaemic control, an initiative being pursued by the DAWN study. Where concerns are tangible, such as fear of hypoglycaemia, therapeutic solutions can be pursued. Overcoming psychological barriers relies more on innovative management techniques. Improving insulin delivery to meet these needs, coupled with enhanced healthcare services, can address psychological insulin resistance and contribute to the maintenance of good metabolic control.},

The goal of the analysis is to make inference about the regression function r between fixed points x = a and x = b. If r(a) and r(b) were known then r could be rescaled by an affine transformation to be a c.d.f., in which case r could be modeled using Bayesian nonparametric methods such as Dirichlet processes. In general, r(a) and r(b) are not known. We propose a model with a prior distribution for (r(a), r(b)) and, conditionally on (r(a), r(b)), a Dirichlet process for r. The error density is assumed to have mode 0 but is otherwise uncertain. It is modeled nonparametrically. Posterior distributions are estimated by successive substitution sampling.}

This procedure is shown to compare well with its predecessors. The center of this smooth and efficient confidence band is then used to estimate a smooth monotone regression function. its pointwise mean squared errors compare favorably with the maximum likelihood estimate, a weighted average of the isotonic regression and the least squares line, and the rank-transformed regression. A numerical example of a binding inhibition assay is included to illustrate the proposed interval and point estimation procedures.},

  Abstract                 = {Bayesian adaptive design has been broadly recognized as a method of improving the efficiency of determining dose-response relationships in clinical trials, thus leading to reliable dose selection for phase III clinical trials. However, in some disease areas such as diabetes and obesity, patients may need to be studied for several weeks or months for a drug effect to emerge. These delayed-response studies provide challenges for using traditional adaptive design methods. Many current methods for analyzing the data at the time of the interim analysis only use the last observation from patients who have completed the study. Data for those patients who have not completed the study are often ignored or imputed via last observation carried forward (LOCF) or other imputation method. Therefore, data collected at intermediate timepoints are not fully used for decision making. These approaches are useful for studies where the final responses can be quickly observed. However, in delayed-response studies, where longitudinal data are normally collected for each patient, using all available information instead of just endpoint values is critical to improving efficiency. Fu and Manner ( 2010 ) proposed an integrated two-component prediction (ITP) model for delayed-response adaptive design. In this paper, we extend their ITP model to incorporate a dose-response model in it and propose an ITP Emax model. Furthermore, we derive a method to find the minimum effective dose (MED) for our newly proposed model by using an optimal design theorem. By using the proposed method, a better understanding of the dose-response relationship and the MED was achieved more efficiently. Potential sample size reduction is also discussed in this paper.}

A semiparametric maximum likelihood estimation procedure is developed for estimating the marginal survival distribution and the pairwise correlation parameters. This produces an efficient estimator of the correlation parameter of the semiparametric normal transformation model, which characterizes the dependence of bivariate survival outcomes. In addition, a simple positive-mass-redistribution algorithm can be used to implement the estimation procedures. Since the likelihood function involves infinite-dimensional parameters, empirical process theory is utilized to study the asymptotic properties of the proposed estimators, which are shown to be consistent, asymptotically normal and semiparametric efficient. A simple estimator for the variance of the estimates is derived. Finite sample performance is evaluated via extensive simulations.},

  Abstract                 = {BACKGROUND: The "integrated safety report" of the drug registration files submitted to health authorities usually summarizes the rates of adverse events observed for a new drug, placebo or active control drugs by pooling the safety data across the trials. Pooling consists of adding the numbers of events observed in a given treatment group across the trials and dividing the results by the total number of patients included in this group. Because it considers treatment groups rather than studies, pooling ignores validity of the comparisons and is subject to a particular kind of bias, termed "Simpson's paradox." In contrast, meta-analysis and other stratified analyses are less susceptible to bias. METHODS: We use a hypothetical, but not atypical, application to demonstrate that the results of a meta-analysis can differ greatly from those obtained by pooling the same data. In our hypothetical model, a new drug is compared to 1) a placebo in 4 relatively small trials in patients at high risk for a certain adverse event and 2) an active reference drug in 2 larger trials of patients at low risk for this event. RESULTS: Using meta-analysis, the relative risk of experiencing the adverse event with the new drug was 1.78 (95% confidence interval [1.02; 3.12]) compared to placebo and 2.20 [0.76; 6.32] compared to active control. By pooling the data, the results were, respectively, 1.00 [0.59; 1.70] and 5.20 [2.07; 13.08]. CONCLUSIONS: Because these findings could mislead health authorities and doctors, regulatory agencies should require meta-analyses or stratified analyses of safety data in drug registration files.}

There are two roles for MTC: one is to strengthen inference concerning the relative efficacy of two treatments, by including both 'direct' and 'indirect' comparisons. The other is to facilitate simultaneous inference regarding all treatments, in order for example to select the best treatment. In this paper, we present a range of Bayesian hierarchical models using the Markov chain Monte Carlo software WinBUGS. These are multivariate random effects models that allow for variation in true treatment effects across trials. We consider models where the between-trials variance is homogeneous across treatment comparisons as well as heterogeneous variance models. We also compare models with fixed (unconstrained) baseline study effects with models with random baselines drawn from a common distribution. These models are applied to an illustrative data set and posterior parameter distributions are compared. We discuss model critique and model selection, illustrating the role of Bayesian deviance analysis, and node-based model criticism. The assumptions underlying the MTC models and their parameterization are also discussed.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixed treatment comparisons (MTC) meta-analysis is a methodology for making inferences on relative treatment effects based on a synthesis of both direct and indirect evidence on multiple treatment contrasts. This is particularly useful in the context of cost-effectiveness analysis and medical decision making. Here, we extend these methods to a more complex situation where trials report results at one or more, different yet fixed, follow-up times. These methods are applied to an illustrative data set combining evidence on healing rates under six different treatments for gastro-esophageal reflux disease (GERD). A series of Bayesian hierarchical models based on piece-wise exponential hazards is developed that borrow strength across the MTC networks and also across time points. These include models for absolute and relative treatment effects, models with fixed or random effects over time, random walk models, and models with homogeneous or heterogeneous between-trials variation. The deviance information criterion (DIC) is used to guide model development and selection. Models for absolute treatment effects generate materially different rankings of the treatments than models that separate the trial-specific baselines from the relative treatment effects. The extent of between-trials heterogeneity in treatment effects depends on treatment contrast. In discussion we note that models of this type have a very wide potential application.

  Abstract                 = {Randomized comparisons among several treatments give rise to an incomplete-blocks structure known as mixed treatment comparisons (MTCs). To analyze such data structures, it is crucial to assess whether the disparate evidence sources provide consistent information about the treatment contrasts. In this article we propose a general method for assessing evidence inconsistency in the framework of Bayesian hierarchical models. We begin with the distinction between basic parameters, which have prior distributions, and functional parameters, which are defined in terms of basic parameters. Based on a graphical analysis of MTC structures, evidence inconsistency is defined as a relation between a functional parameter and at least two basic parameters, supported by at least three evidence sources. The inconsistency degrees of freedom (ICDF) is the number of such inconsistencies. We represent evidence consistency as a set of linear relations between effect parameters on the log odds ratio scale, then relax these relations to allow for inconsistency by adding to the model random inconsistency factors (ICFs). The number of ICFs is determined by the ICDF. The overall consistency between evidence sources can be assessed by comparing models with and without ICFs, whereas their posterior distribution reflects the extent of inconsistency in particular evidence cycles. The methods are elucidated using two published datasets, implemented with standard Markov chain Monte Carlo software.},

Archetypes are considered for scenarios where dose response is highly relevant in clinical practice, as in the symptomatic treatment of acute disorders. Archetypes for scenarios where dose response is less relevant, as in disease modification for neurodegenerative disorders, are beyond the scope of this article. Primary design archetypes are determined by axes of development that are defined by optimism for success (probability of efficacy) and signal detection (magnitude of the anticipated effect size). The fast-to-registration primary archetype uses a dose-response study as the first efficacy, that is, proof of concept (PoC), study and is appropriate when the prospects for signal detection and the optimism for efficacy are higher. These conditions may exist when the anticipated effect size is large and when either testing a drug with a proven mechanism of action or when a favorable biomarker result was obtained in phase 1. The fast-to-PoC primary archetype tests one dose arm to establish PoC before assessing dose response and is appropriate when the optimism for efficacy and the prospects for signal detection are lower. These conditions may exist when testing a drug with a novel mechanism and/or the anticipated effect size is smaller. Secondary archetypes are used to mitigate the trade-offs between the quick-kill fast-to-PoC approach and the quick-win fast-to-registration approach, and are key areas where adaptive designs can be beneficial.},

RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Subjects (n = 322) who were pregnant or planning pregnancy were randomized to IAsp or HI as meal-time insulin in an open-label, parallel-group, multicenter study. Subjects had A1C < or =8% at confirmation of pregnancy. Insulin doses were titrated toward predefined glucose targets and A1C <6.5%. Outcomes assessed included risk of major maternal hypoglycemia, A1C, plasma glucose profiles, and maternal safety outcomes. RESULTS: Major hypoglycemia occurred at a rate of 1.4 vs. 2.1 episodes/year exposure with IAsp and HI, respectively (relative risk 0.720 [95% CI 0.36-1.46]). Risk of major/major nocturnal hypoglycemia was 52% (RR 0.48 [0.20-1.143]; P = NS) lower with IAsp compared with HI. A1C was comparable with human insulin in second (IAsp-HI -0.04 [-0.18 to 0.11]) and third (-0.08 [-0.23 to 0.06]) trimesters. A total of 80% of subjects achieved an A1C < or =6.5%. At the end of first and third trimesters, average postprandial plasma glucose increments were significantly lower with IAsp than HI (P = 0.003 and P = 0.044, respectively), as were mean plasma glucose levels 90 min after breakfast (P = 0.044 and P = 0.001, respectively). Maternal safety profiles and pregnancy outcomes were similar between treatments. CONCLUSIONS: IAsp is at least as safe and effective as HI when used in basal-bolus therapy with NPH insulin in pregnant women with type 1 diabetes and may potentially offer some benefits in terms of postprandial glucose control and preventing severe hypoglycemia.},

The most common approach is to collapse data from all studies and summarize them as if they came from a single study! From a scientific viewpoint this is not optimal as between study variability is not accounted for The dangers of simple pooling are demonstrated with a real example. It is argued that where appropriate, more use should be made of statistical techniques that account for between-study variability; this will be particularly relevant when the treatment allocation ratio is unbalanced across studies.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS: Patients (N = 736) were randomly assigned to docetaxel 100 mg/m(2) plus either placebo or bevacizumab 7.5 or 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS); secondary end points included best overall response, duration of response, time to treatment failure, overall survival, and safety. RESULTS: Combination of bevacizumab 15 mg/kg, but not 7.5 mg/kg, with docetaxel showed superior median PFS (mPFS) to placebo plus docetaxel in unstratified analysis (placebo mPFS, 8.2 months; 7.5 mg/kg mPFS, 9.0 months [hazard ratio (HR), 0.86; P = .12]; 15 mg/kg mPFS, 10.1 months [HR, 0.77; P = .006]) and stratified analysis (placebo mPFS, 8.1 months; 7.5 mg/kg mPFS, 9.0 months [HR, 0.80; P = .045]; 15 mg/kg mPFS, 10.0 months [HR, 0.67; P < .001]). Response rates in patients with measurable disease at baseline also increased with bevacizumab 15 mg/kg (46% [placebo] v 55% [7.5 mg/kg; P = .07] and 64% [15 mg/kg; P < .001]). Combination with bevacizumab had limited impact on the known toxicity profile of docetaxel. CONCLUSION: Combination of bevacizumab with docetaxel did not significantly impact on the safety profile of docetaxel. Bevacizumab 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks significantly increased PFS when combined with docetaxel as first-line therapy for MBC compared with docetaxel plus placebo.},

METHODS: We randomly assigned patients to receive 90 mg of paclitaxel per square meter of body-surface area on days 1, 8, and 15 every 4 weeks, either alone or with 10 mg of bevacizumab per kilogram of body weight on days 1 and 15. The primary end point was progression-free survival; overall survival was a secondary end point. RESULTS: From December 2001 through May 2004, a total of 722 patients were enrolled. Paclitaxel plus bevacizumab significantly prolonged progression-free survival as compared with paclitaxel alone (median, 11.8 vs. 5.9 months; hazard ratio for progression, 0.60; P<0.001) and increased the objective response rate (36.9% vs. 21.2%, P<0.001). The overall survival rate, however, was similar in the two groups (median, 26.7 vs. 25.2 months; hazard ratio, 0.88; P=0.16). Grade 3 or 4 hypertension (14.8% vs. 0.0%, P<0.001), proteinuria (3.6% vs. 0.0%, P<0.001), headache (2.2% vs. 0.0%, P=0.008), and cerebrovascular ischemia (1.9% vs. 0.0%, P=0.02) were more frequent in patients receiving paclitaxel plus bevacizumab. Infection was more common in patients receiving paclitaxel plus bevacizumab (9.3% vs. 2.9%, P<0.001), but febrile neutropenia was uncommon (<1% overall). CONCLUSIONS: Initial therapy of metastatic breast cancer with paclitaxel plus bevacizumab prolongs progression-free survival, but not overall survival, as compared with paclitaxel alone.

  Abstract                 = {Recurrent events models have had considerable attention recently. The majority of approaches show the consistency of parameter estimates under the assumption that censoring is independent of the recurrent events process of interest conditional on the covariates that are included in the model. We provide an overview of available recurrent events analysis methods and present an inverse probability of censoring weighted estimator for the regression parameters in the Andersen-Gill model that is commonly used for recurrent event analysis. This estimator remains consistent under informative censoring if the censoring mechanism is estimated consistently, and it generally improves on the naive estimator for the Andersen-Gill model in the case of independent censoring. We illustrate the bias of ad hoc estimators in the presence of informative censoring with a simulation study and provide a data analysis of recurrent lung exacerbations in cystic fibrosis patients when some patients are lost to follow-up.}

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVES: This analysis first modeled the interaction between hypoglycemia and glycosylated hemoglobin (HbA1c) in clinical trials that compared insulin glargine (glargine) with human neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin (NPH) in patients with type 1 or type 2 diabetes mellitus. The model was then used to compare rates of hypoglycemia associated with use of these insulins. METHODS: Patient-level data from all randomized Phase III/IV clinical trials sponsored by the manufacturer of glargine that compared glargine and NPH and were available in May 2004 were included in the model. In addition, MEDLINE, EMBASE, and BIOSIS were searched for comparative randomized controlled trials of glargine and NPH using the terms insulin glargine, HOE 901, neutral protamine Hagedorn insulin, and NPH insulin. Studies were excluded from the analysis if patient-level data were not available. Unadjusted rates of symptomatic, confirmed, and severe hypoglycemia were compared with those derived from negative binomial regression analysis, which stratified the results by HbA1c at end point (with last observation carried forward), treatment, and duration of diabetes. In addition, the analysis was stratified by Phase III studies (which focused on determining tolerability and efficacy before regulatory approval) and Phase IV studies (which compared the clinical efficacy of the 2 insulins). The first month of the study was not included in the analysis because of continual adjustment of the insulin dose and maintenance of previous NPH in some studies. RESULTS: Eleven sponsored randomized trials were included in the model (total of 5074 patients). Four other sponsored trials were not included because the databases were not finalized, and 3 investigator-initiated trials were not included because patient-level data were unavailable. Rates of hypoglycemia had a curvilinear relationship with HbAlc, increasing at lower end-point HbAlc values. In combined analyses of the studies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes, unadjusted rates of hypoglycemia were lower for glargine than NPH: 6.1% lower for all symptomatic hypoglycemia, 21.6% lower for confirmed hypoglycemia, and 23.9% lower for severe hypoglycemia (all, P < 0.05). When modeled using the negative binomial distribution with end-point HbA1c as a covariate, the corresponding results were 9.1% (P < 0.05), 26.6% (P < 0.001), and 30.0% (P = 0.08), respectively. When only Phase IV trials were analyzed, the relative reductions with glargine were 16.2% (P < 0.01), 40.8% (P < 0.01), and 46.8% (P < 0.05). The results of the separate analyses of studies of type 1 and type 2 diabetes were comparable. CONCLUSIONS: Based on the results of this analysis, calculated unadjusted hypoglycemia event rates appear to underestimate the differences between glargine and NPH. In most of the present analyses, unadjusted rates were significantly lower with glargine than NPH. Adjustment for end-point HbA1c resulted in greater relative reductions in the risk of hypoglycemia for glargine compared with NPH. The adjusted risk reduction with glargine was highest in the Phase IV studies.},

In such cases, interest often focuses on estimating the regression function, while also assessing evidence of art association. This article proposes a new framework for Bayesian isotonic regression and order-restricted inference. Approximating the regression function with a high-dimensional piecewise linear model, the nondecreasing constraint is incorporated through a prior distribution for the slopes consisting of a product mixture of point masses (accounting for flat regions) and truncated normal densities. To borrow information across the intervals and smooth the curve., the prior is formulated as a latent autoregressive normal process. This structure facilitates efficient posterior computation, since the full conditional distributions of the parameters have simple conjugate forms. Point and interval estimates of the regression function and posterior probabilities of an association for different regions of the predictor can be estimated from a single MCMC run. Generalizations to categorical outcomes and multiple predictors are described, and the approach is applied to an epidemiology application.},

  Abstract                 = {Mixed treatment comparison (MTC) is a generalization of meta-analysis. Instead of the same treatment for a disease being tested in a number of studies, a number of different interventions are considered. Meta-regression is also a generalization of meta-analysis where an attempt is made to explain the heterogeneity between the treatment effects in the studies by regressing on study-level covariables. Our focus is where there are several different treatments considered in a number of randomized controlled trials in a specific disease, the same treatment can be applied in several arms within a study, and where differences in efficacy can be explained by differences in the study settings. We develop methods for simultaneously comparing several treatments and adjusting for study-level covariables by combining ideas from MTC and meta-regression. We use a case study from rheumatoid arthritis. We identified relevant trials of biologic verses standard therapy or placebo and extracted the doses, comparators and patient baseline characteristics. Efficacy is measured using the log odds ratio of achieving six-month ACR50 responder status. A random-effects meta-regression model is fitted which adjusts the log odds ratio for study-level prognostic factors. A different random-effect distribution on the log odds ratios is allowed for each different treatment. The odds ratio is found as a function of the prognostic factors for each treatment. The apparent differences in the randomized trials between tumour necrosis factor alpha (TNF- alpha) antagonists are explained by differences in prognostic factors and the analysis suggests that these drugs as a class are not different from each other.},

In practice, there is considerable uncertainty about what the true underlying treatment effect may be, and so power does not give a good indication of the probability that the trial will demonstrate a positive outcome. Assurance is the unconditional probability that the trial will yield a 'positive outcome'. A positive outcome usually means a statistically significant result, according to some standard frequentist significance test. The assurance is then the prior expectation of the power, averaged over the prior distribution for the unknown true treatment effect. We argue that assurance is an important measure of the practical utility of a proposed trial, and indeed that it will often be appropriate to choose the size of the sample (and perhaps other aspects of the design) to achieve a desired assurance, rather than to achieve a desired power conditional on an assumed treatment effect. We extend the theory of assurance to two-sided testing and equivalence trials. We also show that assurance is straightforward to compute in some simple problems of normal, binary and gamma distributed data, and that the method is not restricted to simple conjugate prior distributions for parameters. Several illustrations are given. Copyright (c) 2005 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

  Abstract                 = {Semicompeting risks data are often encountered in clinical trials with intermediate endpoints subject to dependent censoring from informative dropout. Unlike with competing risks data, dropout may not be dependently censored by the intermediate event. There has recently been increased attention to these data, in particular inferences about the marginal distribution of the intermediate event without covariates. In this article, we incorporate covariates and formulate their effects on the survival function of the intermediate event via a functional regression model. To accommodate informative censoring, a time-dependent copula model is proposed in the observable region of the data which is more flexible than standard parametric copula models for the dependence between the events. The model permits estimation of the marginal distribution under weaker assumptions than in previous work on competing risks data. New nonparametric estimators for the marginal and dependence models are derived from nonlinear estimating equations and are shown to be uniformly consistent and to converge weakly to Gaussian processes. Graphical model checking techniques are presented for the assumed models. Nonparametric tests are developed accordingly, as are inferences for parametric submodels for the time-varying covariate effects and copula parameters. A novel time-varying sensitivity analysis is developed using the estimation procedures. Simulations and an AIDS data analysis demonstrate the practical utility of the methodology.},

Although our approach is more widely applicable, we focus for simplicity on estimation of a monotone nondecreasing regression on [0, 1] with additive error, effectively approximating the function of interest by a function having a piecewise linear derivative. Computationally accessible methods of estimation are described through an amalgamation of existing Markov chain Monte Carlo algorithms. Simulations and examples illustrate the approach.},

The family of functions defined by the differential equation D(2)f = w Df, where w is an unconstrained coefficient function, comprises the strictly monotone twice differentiable functions. The solution to this equation is f = C-0 + C-1 D-1{exp(D(-1)w)}, where C-0 and C-1 are arbitrary constants and D-1 is the partial integration operator. A basis for expanding w is suggested that permits explicit integration in the expression of f. In fitting data, it is also useful to regularize f by penalizing the integral of w(2) since this is a measure of the relative curvature in f. Applications are discussed to monotone nonparametric regression, to the transformation of the dependent variable in non-linear regression and to density estimation.},

  Abstract                 = {The typically long delay in starting insulin for patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus may be due in part to uncertainty about how best to make the transition from oral therapy to insulin. Recent studies show that when appropriate glycemic targets are sought, with systematic titration of insulin dosage, several methods of beginning insulin may be successful. Notably, either starting with a single injection of basal insulin or starting with 3 injections of short-acting insulin at mealtimes can be effective. Studies also suggest that continuing oral therapies and using insulin analogues rather than human insulins may improve the effectiveness of insulin treatment relative to the rate of hypoglycemia and gain of weight typically seen in this setting. Starting with a single injection of insulin to control basal glycemia while continuing oral therapy is the simplest approach, and lends itself to stepwise addition of mealtime injections as needed to bring most patients to glycemic targets in a logical and practical way. Future studies should consider not only the ability of regimens to reach hemoglobin A(1c) targets but also the burden of adverse effects accompanying this effort with a given method.},

During the 5-7-week studies, the acceptability of HumaPen Ergo was assessed with a questionnaire which was issued to all patients. The HumaPen Ergo was considered easy/very easy with respect to learning to use (97%), reading dose numbers (95%) and correcting dose mistakes (97%), and 62% considered it easy/very easy to hold during use. HumaPen Ergo features considered easier/much easier compared to the previously used model of pen were ease of correcting dose (Study 1/Study 2: 89%/93%), ease of reading the dose number (77%/61 %) and ease of changing cartridge (54%/68%). At the end of the studies the majority of patients (60%/69%) said that they would continue to use HumaPen Ergo and would recommend it to other patients, even though they had expressed satisfaction with the pen that they had used previously. Health-care professionals evaluated HumaPen Ergo according to the same criteria as the patients and said that they would recommend the HumaPen Ergo owing to ease of dialling back without wasting insulin (80%) and reading dose numbers (74%). The HumaPen Ergo was well accepted by both patients and health-care professionals and provides an important tool to combat the trauma and inconvenience associated with insulin self-injection.},

PATIENTS AND METHODS Patients were randomly assigned in 2:1 ratio to chemotherapy plus BV or chemotherapy plus placebo. Before random assignment, investigators chose capecitabine (Cape; 2,000 mg/m(2) for 14 days), taxane (Tax) -based (nab-paclitaxel 260 mg/m(2), docetaxel 75 or 100 mg/m(2)), or anthracycline (Anthra) -based (doxorubicin or epirubicin combinations [doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide, epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, fluorouracil/epirubicin/cyclophosphamide, or fluorouracil/doxorubicin/cyclophosphamide]) chemotherapy administered every 3 weeks. BV or placebo was administered at 15 mg/kg every 3 weeks. The primary end point was progression-free survival (PFS). Secondary end points included overall survival (OS), 1-year survival rate, objective response rate, duration of objective response, and safety. Two independently powered cohorts defined by the choice of chemotherapy (Cape patients or pooled Tax/Anthra patients) were analyzed in parallel. Results RIBBON-1 (Regimens in Bevacizumab for Breast Oncology) enrolled 1,237 patients (Cape cohort, n = 615; Tax/Anthra cohort, n = 622). Median PFS was longer for each BV combination (Cape cohort: increased from 5.7 months to 8.6 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.69; 95% CI, 0.56 to 0.84; log-rank P < .001; and Tax/Anthra cohort: increased from 8.0 months to 9.2 months; HR, 0.64; 95% CI, 0.52 to 0.80; log-rank P < .001). No statistically significant differences in OS between the placebo- and BV-containing arms were observed. Safety was consistent with results of prior BV trials. CONCLUSION The combination of BV with Cape, Tax, or Anthra improves clinical benefit in terms of increased PFS in first-line treatment of metastatic breast cancer, with a safety profile comparable to prior phase III studies.}

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The purpose of this study was to compare two analog insulin therapies (prandial premixed therapy [PPT] versus basal/bolus therapy [BBT]) in type 2 diabetic patients previously treated with insulin glargine (>or=30 units/day) plus oral agents, with the aim of demonstrating noninferiority of PPT to BBT. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: Patients were randomly assigned to PPT (lispro mix 50/50: 50% insulin lispro protamine suspension and 50% lispro; n = 187) t.i.d. with meals or BBT (glargine at bedtime plus mealtime lispro; n = 187) in a 24-week, multicenter, open-label, noninferiority trial. Investigators could replace lispro mix 50/50 with lispro mix 75/25 at the evening meal if the fasting plasma glucose target was unachievable. RESULTS: Baseline A1C was similar (PPT 8.8%; BBT 8.9%; P = 0.598). At week 24, A1C was lower with BBT (6.78 vs. 6.95%, P = 0.021). A1C was reduced significantly from baseline for both therapies (P < 0.0001). The difference in A1C change from baseline to the end point (BBT minus PPT) was -0.22% (90% CI -0.38 to -0.07). Noninferiority of PPT to BBT was not demonstrated based on the prespecified noninferiority margin of 0.3%. The percentages of patients achieving target A1C <7.0% (PPT versus BBT, respectively) were 54 vs. 69% (P = 0.009) and for target <or=6.5% were 35 vs. 50% (P = 0.01) but did not differ for target <or=6.0% or <7.5%. Rates of hypoglycemia were similar for both groups. CONCLUSIONS: Although noninferiority of PPT to BBT was not demonstrated, findings for A1C reduction, percentage of patients achieving A1C targets, hypoglycemia, and number of required injections should be considered in the individual decision-making process of advancing insulin replacement to PPT versus BBT in type 2 diabetes.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Cisplatin plus gemcitabine is a standard regimen for first-line treatment of advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Phase II studies of pemetrexed plus platinum compounds have also shown activity in this setting. PATIENTS AND METHODS: This noninferiority, phase III, randomized study compared the overall survival between treatment arms using a fixed margin method (hazard ratio [HR] < 1.176) in 1,725 chemotherapy-naive patients with stage IIIB or IV NSCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0 to 1. Patients received cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) on day 1 and gemcitabine 1,250 mg/m(2) on days 1 and 8 (n = 863) or cisplatin 75 mg/m(2) and pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1 (n = 862) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. RESULTS: Overall survival for cisplatin/pemetrexed was noninferior to cisplatin/gemcitabine (median survival, 10.3 v 10.3 months, respectively; HR = 0.94; 95% CI, 0.84 to 1.05). Overall survival was statistically superior for cisplatin/pemetrexed versus cisplatin/gemcitabine in patients with adenocarcinoma (n = 847; 12.6 v 10.9 months, respectively) and large-cell carcinoma histology (n = 153; 10.4 v 6.7 months, respectively). In contrast, in patients with squamous cell histology, there was a significant improvement in survival with cisplatin/gemcitabine versus cisplatin/pemetrexed (n = 473; 10.8 v 9.4 months, respectively). For cisplatin/pemetrexed, rates of grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia (P <or= .001); febrile neutropenia (P = .002); and alopecia (P < .001) were significantly lower, whereas grade 3 or 4 nausea (P = .004) was more common. CONCLUSION: In advanced NSCLC, cisplatin/pemetrexed provides similar efficacy with better tolerability and more convenient administration than cisplatin/gemcitabine. This is the first prospective phase III study in NSCLC to show survival differences based on histologic type.},

In practice, concentration-effect relationships often deviate from a simple linear relationship but without reaching a clear maximum because a further increase in concentration might be associated with unacceptable or distorting side effects. The parameters for the Emax model can only be estimated with reasonable precision if the curve shows sign of reaching a maximum, otherwise both EC50 and Emax estimates may be extremely imprecise. This paper provides a solution by introducing a new parameter (S0) equal to Emax/EC50 that can be used to characterize potency adequately even if there are no signs of a clear maximum. Simulations are presented to investigate the nature of the new parameter and published examples are used as illustration.},

  Abstract                 = {Cause-specific analyses under a competing risks framework have received considerable attention in the statistical literature. Such analyses are useful for comparing mortality patterns across racial and/or age groups. Earlier work in the statistical literature focused on the situation when the cause of death is known. A challenging twist to the problem arises when the cause of death is not known exactly, but can be narrowed down to a set of potential causes that do not necessarily act independently. This phenomenon, referred to as masking, is often the result of incomplete or partial information on death certificates and/or lack of routine autopsy on every patient. In this article we propose a semiparametric Bayesian approach for analyzing competing risks survival data with masked cause of death. The models proposed do not assume independence among the causes, and are valid for an arbitrary number of causes. Further, the Bayesian approach is flexible in allowing a general pattern of missingness for the cause of death. We illustrate our methodology using breast cancer data from the Detroit Surveillance, Epidemiology, and End Results registry. Copyright (C) 2010 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd.},

The purpose of conducting the second clinical trial is to study whether the clinical result from the first trial is reproducible in the second trial with the same study protocol. Under certain circumstance, the FDA Modernization Act of 1997 includes a provision to allow data from one adequate and well-controlled clinical trial investigation and confirmatory evidence to establish effectiveness for risk/benefit assessment of drug and biological candidates for approval. In this paper, we introduce the concept of reproducibility probability for a given clinical trial, which is useful in providing important information for regulatory agencies in deciding whether a single clinical trial is sufficient and for pharmaceutical companies in adjusting the sample size in a future clinical trial. Three approaches, the estimated power approach, the method of confidence bounds and the Bayesian approach, are studied in evaluating reproducibility probabilities under several study designs commonly used in clinical trials.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Following a phase II trial in which pemetrexed-platinum demonstrated similar activity to that of historical etoposide-platinum controls, a phase III study was conducted to compare pemetrexed-carboplatin with etoposide-carboplatin for the treatment of extensive-stage small-cell lung cancer (ES-SCLC). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Chemotherapy-naive patients with ES-SCLC and an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of zero to 2 were randomly assigned to receive pemetrexed-carboplatin (pemetrexed 500 mg/m(2) on day 1; carboplatin at area under the serum concentration-time curve [AUC] 5 on day 1) or etoposide-carboplatin (etoposide 100 mg/m(2) on days 1 through 3; carboplatin AUC 5 on day 1) every 3 weeks for up to six cycles. The primary objective of the study was noninferiority of pemetrexed-carboplatin overall survival with a 15% margin. RESULTS: Accrual was terminated with 908 of 1,820 patients enrolled after results of a planned interim analysis. In the final analysis, pemetrexed-carboplatin was inferior to etoposide-carboplatin for overall survival (median, 8.1 v 10.6 months; hazard ratio [HR],1.56; 95% CI, 1.27 to 1.92; log-rank P < .01) and progression-free survival (median, 3.8 v 5.4 months; HR, 1.85; 95% CI, 1.58 to 2.17; log-rank P < .01). Objective response rates were also significantly lower for pemetrexed-carboplatin (31% v 52%; P < .001). Pemetrexed-carboplatin had lower grade 3 to 4 neutropenia, febrile neutropenia, and leukopenia than etoposide-carboplatin; grade 3 to 4 thrombocytopenia was comparable between arms and anemia was higher in the pemetrexed-carboplatin arm. CONCLUSION: Pemetrexed-carboplatin is inferior for the treatment of ES-SCLC. Planned translational research and pharmacogenomic analyses of tumor and blood samples may help explain the study results and provide insight into new treatment strategies.},

Using an information theoretic argument we derive a measure P-D for the effective number of parameters in a model as the difference between the posterior mean of the deviance and the deviance at the posterior means of the parameters of interest. In general P-D approximately corresponds to the trace of the product of Fisher's information and the posterior covariance, which in normal models is the trace of the 'hat' matrix projecting observations onto fitted values. Its properties in exponential families are explored. The posterior mean deviance is suggested as a Bayesian measure of fit or adequacy, and the contributions of individual observations to the fit and complexity can give rise to a diagnostic plot of deviance residuals against leverages. Adding P-D to the posterior mean deviance gives a deviance information criterion for comparing models, which is related to other information criteria and has an approximate decision theoretic justification. The procedure is illustrated in some examples, and comparisons are drawn with alternative Bayesian and classical proposals. Throughout it is emphasized that the quantities required are trivial to compute in a Markov chain Monte Carlo analysis.},

  Abstract                 = {PURPOSE: Progression free survival (PFS) is increasingly used as a primary end-point in oncology clinical trials. This paper provides recommendations for optimal trial design, conduct and analysis in situations where PFS has the potential to be an acceptable end-point for regulatory approval. PATIENTS AND METHODS: These recommendations are based on research performed by the Pharmaceutical Research and Manufacturers Association (PhRMA) sponsored PFS Working Group, including the re-analysis of 28 randomised Phase III trials from 12 companies/institutions. RESULTS: (1) In the assessment of PFS, there is a critical distinction between measurement error that results from random variation, which by itself tends to attenuate treatment effect, versus bias which increases the probability of a false negative or false positive finding. Investigator bias can be detected by auditing a random sample of patients by blinded, independent, central review (BICR). (2) ITT analyses generally resulted in smaller treatment effects (HRs closer to 1) than analyses that censor patients for potentially informative events (such as starting other anti-cancer therapy). (3) Interval censored analyses (ICA) are more robust to time-evaluation bias than the log-rank test. CONCLUSION: A sample based BICR audit may be employed in open or partially blinded trials and should not be required in true double-blind trials. Patients should be followed until progression even if they have discontinued treatment to be consistent with the ITT principle. ICAs should be a standard sensitivity analysis to assess time-evaluation bias. Implementation of these recommendations would standardize and in many cases simplify phase III oncology clinical trials that use a PFS primary end-point.},

Whilst in many meta-analysis settings the Bayesian models used mirror those previously adopted in a frequentist formulation, there are a number of specific advantages conferred by the Bayesian approach. These include: full allowance for all parameter uncertainty in the model, the ability to include other pertinent information that would otherwise be excluded, and the ability to extend the models to accommodate more complex, but frequently occurring, scenarios. The Bayesian methods discussed are illustrated by means of a meta-analysis examining the evidence relating to electronic fetal heart rate monitoring and perinatal mortality in which evidence is available from a variety of sources.},

Methods Randomized trials of first-line chemotherapy in MCRC were identified, and statistical analyses were undertaken to evaluate the correlations between the end points. Results Thirty-nine randomized controlled trials were identified containing a total of 87 treatment arms. Among trials, the nonparametric Spearman rank correlation coefficient (r(s)) between differences (Delta) in surrogate end points (Delta PFS, Delta TTP, and Delta RR) and Delta OS were 0.74 ( 95% CI, 0.47 to 0.88), 0.52 ( 95% CI, 0.004 to 0.81), 0.39 ( 95% CI, 0.08 to 0.63), respectively. The r(s) for Delta PFS was not significantly different from the r(s) Delta TTP (P = .28). Linear regression analysis was performed using hazard ratios for PFS and OS. There was a strong relationship between hazard ratios for PFS and OS; the slope of the regression line was 0.54 +/- 0.10, indicating that a novel therapy producing a 10% risk reduction for PFS will yield an estimated 5.4% +/- 1% risk reduction for OS. Conclusion In first-line chemotherapy trials for MCRC, improvements in PFS are strongly associated with improvements in OS. In this patient population, PFS may be an appropriate surrogate for OS. As a clinical end point, PFS offers increased statistical power at a given time of analysis and a significant lead time advantage compared with OS.},

  Abstract                 = {Anticancer cytotoxic agents go through a process by which their antitumor activity-on the basis of the amount of tumor shrinkage they could generate-has been investigated. In the late 1970s, the International Union Against Cancer and the World Health Organization introduced specific criteria for the codification of tumor response evaluation. In 1994, several organizations involved in clinical research combined forces to tackle the review of these criteria on the basis of the experience and knowledge acquired since then. After several gears of intensive discussions, a new set of guidelines is ready that will supersede the former criteria. In parallel to this initiative, one of the participating groups developed a model by which response rates could be derived from unidimensional measurement of tumor lesions instead of the usual bidimensional approach. This new concept has been largely validated by the Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors Group and integrated into the present guidelines. This special article also provides some philosophic background to clarify the various purposes of response evaluation. It proposes a model by which a combined assessment of all existing lesions, characterized by target lesions (to be measured) and nontarget lesions, is used to extrapolate an overall response to treatment. Methods of assessing tumor lesions are better codified, briefly within the guidelines and in more detail in Appendix I. All other aspects of response evaluation have been discussed, reviewed, and amended whenever appropriate.}

  Abstract                 = {Application of a sigmoid Emax model is described for the assessment of dose-response with designs containing a small number of doses (typically, three to six). The expanded model is a common Emax model with a power (Hill) parameter applied to dose and the ED50 parameter. The model will be evaluated following a strategy proposed by Bretz et al. (2005). The sigmoid Emax model is used to create several contrasts that have high power to detect an increasing trend from placebo. Alpha level for the hypothesis of no dose-response is controlled using multiple comparison methods applied to the p-values obtained from the contrasts. Subsequent to establishing drug activity, Bayesian methods are used to estimate the dose-response curve from the sparse dosing design. Bayesian estimation applied to the sigmoid model represents uncertainty in model selection that is missed when a single simpler model is selected from a collection of non-nested models. The goal is to base model selection on substantive knowledge and broad experience with dose-response relationships rather than criteria selected to ensure convergence of estimators. Bayesian estimation also addresses deficiencies in confidence intervals and tests derived from asymptotic-based maximum likelihood estimation when some parameters are poorly determined, which is typical for data from common dose-response designs.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The HumaPen Memoir (HPM) is a new reusable insulin injection pen. It possesses an electronic component so that 16 insulin doses are stored in the memory. This study's aim was to evaluate the functionality of the device (i.e., ability to deliver a set dose of insulin), its impact on patient safety, and patient/healthcare professional (HCP) acceptance. RESEARCH DESIGN AND METHODS: In this 6-10-week (3 visit) multinational, multi-centre, open-label, single-arm outpatient study, participants with type 1 or type 2 diabetes were assigned to inject either their prandial or basal insulin dose using the HPM and instructed to record all complaints with the study pen or user manual. Investigators submitted a complaint form to the sponsor for each participant complaint, and for adverse events (AEs) potentially related to the study pen. Where a complaint was possibly related to a pen malfunction, the pen was returned to the sponsor for assessment. Participant/HCP acceptance of the HPM was evaluated using questionnaires. RESULTS: Of the 300 participants (mean age 52 [SD 15] years), 58% were male and 62% had type 2 diabetes. The mean duration of pre-study pen use was 7 years. The average exposure to the HPM was 8.2 (SD 1.6) weeks. Overall, 314 study pens were used (14 were replacements). Functional complaints were reported for 24 devices (7.6%), of which 8 (2.5%) were permanent electronic failures, and 15 (4.8%) were user-related (1 pen not returned for assessment). None of these functional issues resulted in a serious AE. Non-functional complaints were reported for 33 devices (10.5%). There were no pen-related hypoglycemic episodes and 2 pen-related hyperglycemic episodes were reported. The majority of participants (81.4%) preferred the HPM over their pre-study pen. The new insulin pen was generally rated higher than the pre-study pen for pen features and tasks associated with everyday pen use. CONCLUSIONS: No major functional issue of the HPM resulting in a serious AE was reported in this study. Based on the study results this new insulin pen demonstrated a favorable benefit-risk profile.},

Here we express tau as an integral functional of the bivariate survival function and construct a natural estimator via the von Mises functional approach. This does not necessarily yield a consistent estimator since tail region information on the survival curve may not be identifiable due to right censoring. To assess the magnitude of the inconsistency we propose some estimable bounds on tau. It is shown that estimates of the bounds shrink to provide consistency if the largest observations on both marginal coordinates are uncensored and satisfy certain regularity conditions. The bounds depend on the sample size, on censoring rates and, in particular, on the estimated probability of the unknown tail region. We also discuss using the bootstrap method for variance estimation and bias correction. Two illustrative data examples are analyzed, as well as some simulation results.},

Identifying the 'optimal' dose is the rate-limiting step since conventional methods, estimating the full posterior predictive distribution of some utility function under each of the possible doses, are very slow. We explore a simpler strategy based on importance sampling, whereby the posterior mean of the utility at each candidate dose is estimated by taking its average across an empirical distribution for the model parameters from the current Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) run, weighted according to the likelihood of one or more predicted observations. We identify appropriate settings for this algorithm and illustrate its application in the context of a normal dynamic linear model used in a dose-finding clinical trial of a neutrophil inhibitory factor in acute ischaemic stroke.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: In many individuals with diabetes, the unpleasant symptoms and negative consequences associated with hypoglycemia may result in significant anxiety or even a fear of hypoglycemia (FoH). This fear may have significant clinical implications for diabetes management. The aim of this review is to integrate existing research on FoH (its measurement, predictors, correlates, impact and treatment) and discuss its implications for diabetes management and patient education. METHODS: A literature search was conducted using Medline and Embase. The search was limited to journal articles published in English from 1985 to 2007 inclusive. Three hundred and one abstracts were reviewed and 273 were rejected on the basis of non-relevance. In addition to the 28 papers included, six additional papers were identified by further searches and were added to this review. RESULTS: FoH appears to be a widespread phenomenon. It is measured primarily through the use of a specific scale, the Hypoglycemic Fear Survey (HFS). There are a number of factors that relate to whether an individual is likely to develop FoH including whether there is a history of hypoglycemia in an individual, length of time since first insulin treatment, and a higher level of variability in blood glucose level. FoH has been linked to both state and trait anxiety although the relationship is complex. CONCLUSIONS: There is evidence that FoH may have a significant negative impact on diabetes management, metabolic control and subsequent health outcomes. There is evidence that blood glucose (BG) awareness training and CBT can reduce levels of fear and improve disease management. More research is needed on how FoH arises and the individual variables which predict its development. In addition, well designed research is required to better understand the behavioral and medical impact of FoH, and interventions to reduce it. PRACTICE IMPLICATIONS: There is some evidence to suggest that interventions including BG awareness training and cognitive behavioral therapy can reduce levels of fear and improve disease management. While many aspects of FoH require further well-designed research, it is evident that this phenomenon can have a major impact on diabetes management and needs to be specifically addressed in patient education programs.},

The intended application is in censored multistate and multivariate survival settings, where point processes are continuously observed. These data differ from other functional data, like longitudinal data, which are discretely observed at irregular times. Existing functional approaches to survival processes use intensity models, which require smoothing and depend critically on the choice of smoothing parameters, similarly to discretely observed data. In this article we study functional mean and association regression models for the point processes, with unspecified time-varying coefficients. The continuous observation scheme is exploited; the coefficients may be estimated nonparametrically by extending generalized estimating equations to continuously observed data. The estimators automatically converge at the parametric rate without smoothing, unlike with discretely observed data. Uniform consistency and weak convergence is established with empirical process techniques. The nonparametric estimators yield new tests for covariate effects, parametric submodeling of these effects, and goodness-of-fit testing. Simulation studies and an analysis of familial aggregation of alcoholism illustrate the methodology's practical utility.},

  Abstract                 = {OBJECTIVE: The role of maternal hypoglycemia during pregnancy has not yet been established. We sought to estimate the prevalence of undiagnosed, asymptomatic hypoglycemic events that occur in diabetic patients. METHODS: All patients were evaluated using a continuous glucose monitoring system for 72 consecutive hours. The continuous glucose monitoring system measures in subcutaneous tissue interstitial glucose levels within a range of 40-400 mg/dL every 5 minutes for a total of 288 measurements per day. All patients were instructed regarding diabetic diet and assigned to pharmacological treatment as needed. Patients documented the time of food intake, insulin or glyburide administration, and all clinical hypoglycemic events. An asymptomatic hypoglycemic episode was defined as more than 30 consecutive minutes of glucose value below 50 mg/dL detected only by continuous glucose monitoring system reading without patient awareness. RESULTS: An evaluation of 82 patients with gestational diabetes was performed; 30 were insulin-treated, 27 were managed by diet only, and 25 were patients treated with glyburide. For purposes of comparison, data were obtained from 35 nondiabetic gravid women. Asymptomatic hypoglycemic events were identified in 19 of 30 (63%) insulin-treated patients and in 7 of 25 (28%) glyburide-treated patients. No hypoglycemic events were identified in patients with gestational diabetes mellitus treated by diet alone or in nondiabetic subjects. The mean recorded hypoglycemic episodes per day was significantly higher in insulin-treated patients (4.2 +/- 2.1) than in glyburide-treated patients (2.1 +/- 1.1), P =.03. In insulin-treated patients, the majority of the hypoglycemic events were nocturnal (84%), whereas in glyburide-treated patients, episodes were identified equally by day and night. CONCLUSION: Our data suggest that asymptomatic hypoglycemic events are common during pharmacological treatment in gestational diabetic pregnancies. We speculate that this finding may be explained by treatment modality rather than by the disease itself.},

  Abstract                 = {High dimension low sample size data, like the microarray gene expression levels, pose numerous challenges to conventional statistical methods. In the particular case of binary classification, some classification methods, such as the support vector machine (SVM), can efficiently deal with high-dimensional predictors, but lacks the accuracy in estimating the probability of membership of a class. In contrast, the traditional logistic regression (TLR) effectively estimates the probability of class membership for data with low-dimensional inputs, but does not handle high-dimensional cases. The study bridges the gap between SVM and TLR by their loss functions. Based on the proposed new loss function, a pseudo-logistic regression and classification approach which simultaneously combines the strengths of both SVM and TLR is also proposed. Simulation evaluations and real data applications demonstrate that for low-dimensional data, the proposed method produces regression estimates comparable to those of TLR and penalized logistic regression, and that for high-dimensional data, the new method possesses higher classification accuracy than SVM and, in the meanwhile, enjoys enhanced computational convergence and stability.

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Objective: This study compared differences in healthcare costs and resource utilization for acute coronary syndrome (ACS) patients with and without diabetes mellitus (DM). Methods: A retrospective cohort study of a large, US employer-based claims database identified adults hospitalized for ACS between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2006 and categorized them based on DM status. Resource utilization and costs during the index hospitalization and in the 12-month follow-up period were compared for ACS patients with and without DM using the propensity score stratification bootstrapping method, adjusting for differences in demographic and clinical characteristics. Results: Of 12,502 patients who met selection criteria, 3,040 (24%) had a history of DM and 9,462 (76%) did not. Patients with DM were older, female, and had higher rates of previous cardiovascular and renal diseases. After the propensity score stratification, patients with DM incurred higher index hospitalization costs ($32,577 vs. $29,150, p < 0.01) as well as higher total follow-up healthcare costs ($35,400 vs. $24,080, p < 0.01), including higher inpatient ($17,278 vs. $11,247, p < 0.01), outpatient ($12,357 vs. $8,853, p < 0.01), and pharmacy costs ($5,765 vs. $3,980, p < 0.01). Limitations: General limitations exist with any retrospective claims database analysis including potential diagnostic or procedural coding inaccuracies. Additionally, the patient population was representative of a working-age population with employer-sponsored health insurance and results may not be generalizable to other patient populations. Conclusions: DM is significantly associated with increased healthcare resource utilization and costs for ACS patients.}

If no assumption about the relationship between the two times is made, the marginal survival functions are not identifiable. A natural function that defines the association between the two random variables is the copula. We show that if this function is known then the competing risks data are sufficient to identify the marginal survival functions and construct a suitable estimator. This estimator is consistent and reduces to the Kaplan-Meier estimator when death and censoring times are independent. This statistic can be used to provide bounds on the marginal survival functions based on a range of possible associations between the competing risks.},

  Abstract                 = {Abstract Objective: Recent guidelines recommend use of aspirin and either clopidogrel or prasugrel for at least 12 months following use of drug-eluting or bare metal stents in patients with acute coronary syndromes (ACS) undergoing percutaneous coronary intervention (PCI). This study evaluated factors associated with clopidogrel use and adherence in ACS patients following PCI. Research design and methods: The US employer-based MarketScan commercial claims database was used to examine factors associated with clopidogrel use and adherence. Adherence was defined as a medication possession ratio of 80% or higher. Multivariate logistic regression analyses were conducted to identify factors associated with clopidogrel use and adherence and included patient demographics, comorbidities, and prior beta-blocker, statin, and angiotensin converting enzyme inhibitor (BSI) use as factors. Results: A total of 10,465 patients aged 18-65 years who met inclusion criteria were hospitalized for ACS and underwent PCI between 01/01/2005 and 12/31/2006. Overall, the rate of clopidogrel use was 92.8% for ACS-PCI patients and 66.8% of the clopidogrel users were adherent. Receiving PCI without stenting (Odds Ratio [OR] = 3.28), comorbid hypertension (OR = 1.50), diabetes (OR = 1.49), and atrial fibrillation (OR = 1.91) were associated with decreased filled prescriptions for clopidogrel. Younger age (OR = 0.83) and prior use of clopidogrel (OR = 0.54) or other BSI medications (OR = 0.44) were associated with increased use of clopidogrel (all p values < 0.05). Factors significantly associated with non-adherence of clopidogrel were prior use of clopidogrel (OR = 1.40), prior hospitalization (OR = 1.34), chronic pulmonary disease (OR = 1.31), PCI without stenting (OR = 1.32), diabetes (OR = 1.17), and younger age (OR = 1.29). Prior use of BSI medications (OR = 0.82) increased adherence to clopidogrel. Conclusions: Prior use of clopidogrel, comorbid conditions such as diabetes and chronic pulmonary disease, prior hospitalization, PCI without stenting, and younger age had a negative impact on clopidogrel adherence. These findings may assist programs to improve thienopyridine compliance through a better understanding of patients' disease profiles and concomitant medication use.}
